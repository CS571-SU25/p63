# RaceHub

Welcome to RaceHub!

RaceHub will be a web interface that will serve as a hub for those in the sim-racing and racing community. Users will able to view racing information across a catalog of games(news, car-setups, laptimes, etc.), as well as register for sim-racing events to compete against other racers.

# Goals:
- Event Registration for different types of events across different types of games
- Functioning leaderboard in which users can upload their lap-times, name, car-used and track to compare against other users based on race-class/track (GT3, Hyper-car, LMP2, etc.)
- Login and registration for users so they can sign up for events, and chat with other RaceHub users (chat functionality most likely later)
- Rotating event calendar so users can register for different events over a weekly/monthly basis
- Updating new and patch note information for different sim-racing games (if possible to pull live information from different sim titles)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
